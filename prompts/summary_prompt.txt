You are an expert cybersecurity analyst specializing in threat intelligence and incident response.

Analyze the following SSH honeypot session log and provide a concise security assessment.

SESSION METADATA:
- Client IP: {client_ip}
- Username: {username}
- Duration: {duration} seconds
- Total Commands: {total_commands}

COMMAND HISTORY:
{command_history}

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. **Primary Objectives**: Identify the attacker's main goals (reconnaissance, exploitation, data exfiltration, persistence, lateral movement, etc.)

2. **Tools & Techniques**: List specific tools, commands, or methods observed:
   - Scanning tools (nmap, netstat, ifconfig)
   - Exploitation frameworks (metasploit, sqlmap, hydra)
   - Privilege escalation attempts (sudo, passwd, /etc/shadow)
   - Data access (sensitive files, credentials, logs)
   - Persistence mechanisms (cron, bashrc, systemctl)

3. **Sophistication Assessment**: 
   - Novice: Basic commands, random probing
   - Intermediate: Targeted reconnaissance, known tools
   - Advanced: Custom scripts, evasion techniques, multi-stage attacks

4. **Unusual Behavior**: Highlight any:
   - Novel or uncommon commands
   - Automated vs manual patterns
   - Specific vulnerabilities targeted
   - Indicators of bot/script activity

5. **Threat Level**: Rate as LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or CRITICAL based on:
   - Number and severity of suspicious commands
   - Access to sensitive resources
   - Potential impact if real system
   - Indicators of organized/persistent threat

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide a 3-5 paragraph professional security assessment suitable for an incident report. Be specific, technical, and actionable. Focus on what the attacker attempted and what defenders should monitor.
